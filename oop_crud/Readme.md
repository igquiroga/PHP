# OPP CRUD

I used this project to create a OOP CRUD with:

✅ HTML

✅ CSS

✅ PHP

✅ MYSQL

For this project, I used a Person class that inheritance from a Connection class

Then, at the IndexQuery file I set all the statics methods using that Person's methods.

Finally, at the Index file we can echo all the statics methods setted on the IndexQuery file.



## Features

✅ update()
